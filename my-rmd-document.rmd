Here is some inline code `r 1 + 1`

```{r, starwars-plot, fig.cap = "A ggplot of starwars stuff"}
library(tidyverse)
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = height , y = mass) + geom_point()
```
We can see in Figure \@ref(fig:starwars-plot) a scatterplot. 

```{r starwars-tbl}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  select(name, height, mass, homeworld) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table of starwars data")
```

We can see in Table \@ref(tab:starwars-tbl) a data table. 

```{r, my-fig, fig.cap = "My non-code figure Ronaldo"}
knitr::include_graphics('ronaldo.jpg')
```
We can see in Figure \@ref(fig:my-fig) Ronaldo's picture.
